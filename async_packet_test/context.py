        '''Sniff for packets based on match predicate

        Launch a sniffer that looks for packets that match the supplied
        predicate. The idea is that you can use the function to "expect"
        some future result, and assert against it's result. As an example,
        you could write a predicate that looks for a source mac address:

            class saw_src_mac(Predicate):
                def __init__(self, mac):
                    self._mac = mac

                def stop_condition(self, pkt):
                    return pkt.haslayer(Ether) and pkt[Ether].src == self._mac

                def on_finish(self, timed_out):
                    return not timed_out

        Is used like the following:

            test = context.expect('eth0', saw_src_mac('ab:ab:ab:ab:ab:ab'))
            assert(test.result() == True)

        If the underlying sniffer sees a packet that matches, then the
        future's result will return True.

        Calling `result()` on the future will block until the condition is
        met, or the timeout is reached.

        Args:
            iface (str): Network interface to monitor
            predicate (Predicate): Function to apply against matching
                packet
            timeout (float): Period of time to monitor for packets.
